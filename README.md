Cat vs Dog Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Project Overview

Objective:
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs, demonstrating the capabilities of deep learning in image classification tasks.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Gathered a large dataset of labeled images containing both cats and dogs from online sources or datasets like Kaggle.
Ensured a balanced distribution of images across classes for training.
Data Preprocessing:

Resized images to a uniform size and converted them to a standardized format (e.g., RGB).
Augmented data by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase dataset variability.
Model Architecture Design:

Designed a CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Experimented with different network architectures, activation functions, and regularization techniques to optimize performance.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.
Trained the CNN model using the training set, adjusting model parameters through backpropagation.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance on the validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conducted error analysis to identify common misclassifications and areas for improvement.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Tuned hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate to optimize model performance.
Utilized techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameter values.
Model Deployment:

Deployed the trained CNN model for inference on new images of cats and dogs.
Created a user-friendly interface for users to upload images and receive classification results.
Model Interpretation and Visualization:

Visualized model predictions and confidence scores using techniques like confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Interpreted model decision-making processes by visualizing feature maps and activation patterns.
